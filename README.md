- Are you tired of the lack of trust around the organization?

- Are you tired of the exclusivity of [certain repos](http://www.heinzmarketing.com/assets/yousuck.jpg).

- Are you tired able of not being able to work on new and exciting projects?

- Are you tired of not being able to quickly respond to innovative startups and quickly implement new ideas?

- Are you fed up of people telling you why you can't do something?

- Are you tired of people being afraid to take risks?

-  Are you tired of having 100 useless meetings for every little feature only to build something that is not as good as something you could have built in a fraction of the time if everyone would just stop talking and start doing?

**Well we are fed up, too!**

- It's time we start empowering people to innovate and (as a community) stop being afraid of making mistakes.  
- It's time we start trusting people to put the needs of the community over their own needs.
- It's time we start trusting people to discuss big changes with the community.
- It's time we start trusting people to get design reviews.
 
The days of exclusivity are over.  Let the hacking begin.

**Join the [revolution](https://stash.orbitz.net/users/bgibson/repos/awesome/browse/revolutionaries/) today.**
